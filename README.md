# Tableau-Homework
 CitiBike Analysis via tableau and python

I'm pretty sure the data for 49 year olds is bogus.  Or I fat fingered something in my python notebook and somehow made it a massive number.  
I did clean out some obviously bogus birthdates (1880?) and speeds.  
Speeds are estimated by taking the "as the crow flies" distance, adding 20% and dividing that by the time between check-in/out.

Don't love my visualizations as far as how good they look, but except for the 49 yr olds, I'm confident in my data.
